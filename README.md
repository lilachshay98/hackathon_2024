  # Hackathon 2024 - Optimizing public Transportation

This project implements a machine learning model to predict the number of passengers boarding a bus at each station. The model is trained using historical bus schedule data and employs linear regression for prediction. 

## Features
- Data preprocessing to handle missing and inconsistent values.
- Linear regression models trained per station.
- Predictions are stored in a CSV file.
- Evaluates performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Handles outlier detection and time-based data validation.
  
## Libraries
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
- sklearn
- numpy
- tqdm
- joblib
- datetime
